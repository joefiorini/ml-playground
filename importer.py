"""
This code was generated by OpenAI's GPT-3 model.

The code dynamically retrieves the directory of the currently running script, 
uses that as the root folder, and iterates over each subdirectory in the root folder. 
For each subdirectory, it checks if it contains a subdirectory that has an '__init__.py' file (a Python package). 
If it does, the parent directory is added to sys.path, allowing Python to find and import modules from these packages.
