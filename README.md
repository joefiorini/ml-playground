# Here be dragons

Very, very powerful dragons. Turn back now warrior or forever seal your fate.

This code is a tumultuous maelstrom, the echo of my venture into the LLM model frontier. A labyrinth of experimentation and relentless revision, as treacherous as a dragon's lair.

Brave not this storm, adventurer, for what lies within is as wild and unpredictable as a dragon's flame. Retreat now, save thyself from the whirlwind of chaos, or press on and brace for the tempest that awaits.
